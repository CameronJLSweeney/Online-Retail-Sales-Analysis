# Online-Retail-Sales-Analysis
Analysis of the Online Retail Sales Dataset from Kaggle

Project Overview
This project analyzes transactional data from an online retail business to uncover sales patterns, customer behavior, and high-level business performance. Using SQL and Python, the analysis moves from foundational metrics to more detailed insights across customers, geography, and time. The goal is to demonstrate practical data analytics skills while producing insights that could inform real-world business decisions.

Objectives
-Understand the overall scale and performance of the business
-Analyze customer activity and purchasing behavior
-Identify country-level sales patterns
-Examine revenue trends over time
-Practice combining SQL querying with Python-based analysis and visualization

Dataset
-Online Retail Dataset (Kaggle)
-Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository (via Kaggle)
-Contains transactional data including invoices, products, quantities, prices, customers, dates, and countries
-Represents real-world retail data with common challenges such as missing values and cancellations

Tools & Technologies
-Python: pandas, matplotlib
-SQL: SQLite (via pandas read_sql)
-Jupyter Notebook: Analysis and documentation

Analysis Structure
1. Data Loading & Cleaning
-Imported raw retail data
-Handled missing values and removed invalid transactions
-Ensured correct data types for dates and numeric fields

2. High-Level Business Metrics
-Total unique customers
-Total invoices
-Total revenue
-Established baseline context for deeper analysis

3. Customer Analysis
-Distribution of purchases across customers
-Identification of high-value and repeat customers

4. Country-Level Insights
-Revenue and order distribution by country
-Comparison of domestic vs. international sales performance

5. Time-Based Analysis
-Revenue trends over time
-Identification of seasonal or monthly patterns

6. Key Findings & Takeaways
-Summary of actionable business insights

Key Insights (Summary)
-A relatively small subset of customers contributes a large portion of revenue
-Sales are concentrated in a few key countries, with noticeable international variation
-Revenue shows clear time-based patterns that could inform staffing, inventory, and marketing decisions

Limitations
-Dataset reflects historical data from a specific period and retailer
-No demographic customer information is available
-Analysis does not account for marketing campaigns or external economic factors

Final Takeaways
This project demonstrates an end-to-end analytics workflow: asking business questions, extracting insights using SQL, analyzing data in Python, and communicating findings clearly. The techniques used here mirror real-world business analytics tasks and are applicable across retail, e-commerce, and customer analytics roles.
